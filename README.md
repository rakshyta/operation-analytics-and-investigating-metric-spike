# Operation Analytics and Investigating Metric Spike

**Project Description:** 
The purpose of this project is to perform data analysis on the ‘job_data’ table, focusing on four main tasks: Jobs Reviewed Over Time, Throughput Analysis, Language Share Analysis, and Duplicate Rows Detection. The analysis aims to gain insights into the job review patterns, review throughput, language distribution, and data quality issues in the table. By completing these tasks, we can better understand how jobs are reviewed, identify any performance trends, assess language preferences, and ensure data accuracy.

**Approach:** 
To accomplish the analysis, I followed these steps:  Familiarized myself with the ‘job_data’ table's structure and columns.  Formulated SQL queries for each task, considering the appropriate filters, groupings, and calculations needed for each analysis.  Executed the queries in MySQL Workbench, connected to the database containing the ‘job_data’ table.  Reviewed the results to gain insights into the data patterns and trends.  Ensured data quality by identifying and handling duplicate rows.

**Tech-Stack Used:** 
For this project, I utilized the following software and tools:  MySQL Workbench: Used to interact with the MySQL database, write and execute SQL queries, and visualize the results.  Excel: Utilized to store and manipulate the dataset.
